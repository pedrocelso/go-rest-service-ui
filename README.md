# go-rest-service-ui

An really basic UI for https://github.com/pedrocelso/go-rest-service using React.

Currently this UI is running on: https://pedrocelso.com.br
The api is running on: https://api.pedrocelso.com.br

Both services are hosted on Google App Engine.

More to come!

# To do
1. Add other api services.
2. Add redux or mobX to control state (if needed)/
